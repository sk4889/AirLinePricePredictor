PRICE PREDICTION OF AIRLINES
Create a predictive model using machine learning techniques to estimate the cost of air travel based on the dataset's characteristics.

Airline companies have a fixed number of seats in their planes and utilize a dynamic pricing model to maximize revenue by adjusting prices based on demand. Factors such as holidays, peak times, route length, number of stops, and seating class can influence demand. It is crucial for airlines to accurately model demand to sell all seats and increase profitability. In this project, the aim is to create a predictive model of airline pricing changes using various features. The model will assist passengers in making purchasing decisions by forecasting how airfare prices may fluctuate in the future. The project will provide three files for analysis.
